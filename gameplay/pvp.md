# PvP

## Regular

It is a casual mode with no entry fee where players earn soft currency and XP.

## Ranked

It is a competitive mode where players earn rank points and advance through ranks from Stone to Diamond. Players must pay an entry fee in hard currency, and higher ranks offer greater rewards but also introduce the risk of losing rank points upon defeat.
