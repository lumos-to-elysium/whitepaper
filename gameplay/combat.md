# Combat

Combat in Elysium is turn-based, involving strategic use of creature abilities. Each turn, players select abilities to use against opponents, with the combat system governed by a timer to ensure quick decision-making. Winning or losing in combat influences the player's rewards, with detailed combat results shown in pop-ups after each match.
