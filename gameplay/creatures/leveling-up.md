# Leveling up

In **Beast Borne**, leveling up creatures is a crucial aspect of gameplay that enhances their strength, abilities, and overall battle performance. By investing resources into leveling up your creatures, you can unlock their full potential, making them more formidable opponents in both PvE and PvP modes.

## **How Leveling Up Works**

Creatures start at level 1 and can be progressively leveled to increase their health, damage output, and access to more powerful abilities. Each level-up requires a specific amount of **Crystals**, which players can earn through gameplay activities such as completing missions, winning battles, and claiming daily rewards.

### **Level-Up Costs**

The following table outlines the Crystals required to level up creatures from levels 1 through 9:

| **Level** | **Crystals Required** |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Level 1   | 300 Crystals          |
| Level 2   | 507 Crystals          |
| Level 3   | 858 Crystals          |
| Level 4   | 1,451 Crystals        |
| Level 5   | 2,453 Crystals        |
| Level 6   | 4,148 Crystals        |
| Level 7   | 7,014 Crystals        |
| Level 8   | 11,861 Crystals       |
| Level 9   | 20,057 Crystals       |

As the level increases, the cost of leveling up grows, reflecting the significant improvements in creature capabilities that each new level brings.

## **Strategic Considerations**

Leveling up is an investment that requires strategic planning. Players must decide which creatures to prioritize based on their role in the playerâ€™s overall strategy and the specific challenges they face in missions and ranked matches. Higher-level creatures can provide a significant edge in tougher battles, making wise allocation of Crystals critical to success.

## **Earning Crystals for Leveling Up**

Players can earn the necessary Crystals through various in-game activities, including:

* **Completing PvE Missions**: Earn Crystals by completing missions and gaining stars based on performance.
* **Winning PvP Matches**: Victories in PvP matches reward players with Crystals, which can be used to level up creatures.
* **Daily Rewards**: Collect Crystals through daily logins and mission completions.

Investing in leveling up your creatures is vital to mastering the game and excelling in solo and competitive play. By carefully managing resources and strategically enhancing your creatures, you can build a team capable of taking on the toughest challenges in Beast Borne.
