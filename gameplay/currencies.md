# Currencies

In **Beast Borne**, the in-game economy is powered by two currencies: **Crystals** and **Coins (BST)**. These currencies enhance your gameplay experience, allowing you to acquire items, upgrade creatures, and participate in various game activities.

## **Crystals**

**Crystals** are the primary in-game currency used for everyday transactions and upgrades within the game. They are earned through gameplay and utilized for various in-game activities:

* **Buying Items**: Use Crystals to purchase items from the in-game shop, such as Healing Potions and other essential supplies to aid your journey.
* **Creature Level Up**: Spend Crystals to level up your creatures, increasing their strength and capabilities in battles.
* **Reshuffling Ability Cards**: Use Crystals to reshuffle your creature’s ability cards, optimizing their skills and enhancing your strategic options.

**How to Earn Crystals:** Crystals are earned through regular gameplay activities, including:

* **Gaining Stars in PvE Missions**: Earn Crystals by completing PvE missions with high performance, based on the number of stars you achieve.
* **Daily PvE Missions**: Participate in daily missions to collect Crystals as a reward.
* **Winning Matches**: Earn Crystals by winning both ranked and regular PvP matches.
* **Rank-Up Rewards**: Receive Crystals when you achieve new ranks in the game.
* **Daily Rewards**: Collect Crystals through the game’s daily reward system, simply by logging in and playing regularly.

## **Coins (BST)**

**Coins (BST)** are the premium cryptocurrency within the **Beast Borne** ecosystem, used for more advanced features and transactions. Unlike Crystals, which are virtual in-game currency, Coins (BST) are an ERC-20 token operating on the Polygon network, adding real-world value to your in-game activities.

**Uses of Coins (BST) include:**

* **Ranked Match Entry Fees**: Pay entry fees in Coins to participate in ranked PvP matches, with higher stakes and rewards.
* **Breeding Costs**: Use Coins to breed creatures, creating new offspring with unique traits that enhance your gameplay.
* **Reshuffling Ability Cards**: Perform standard or premium reshuffles of ability cards using Coins, giving you greater control over your creature’s abilities.
* **Premium Reshuffling**: Opt for premium reshuffling, which allows you to choose from multiple ability cards, offering better strategic customization.

**How to Earn Coins (BST):** Coins (BST) are earned through more challenging and significant in-game achievements, such as:

* **Gaining Stars for a Chapter**: Earn Coins by completing entire chapters with high performance based on the number of stars you accumulate.
* **Daily PvE Missions**: Coins can also be earned through daily missions, though in smaller amounts compared to Crystals.
* **Winning Ranked Matches**: Compete in and win ranked PvP matches to receive Coins as part of your victory rewards.
* **Rank Rewards**: As you climb the ranks in the game, you’ll earn Coins as part of your progression rewards.
