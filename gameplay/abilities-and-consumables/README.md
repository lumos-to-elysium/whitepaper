<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/abilities_ico.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Each creature possesses a set of abilities that are crucial in combat. Abilities are categorized by targeting type—single-target, multi-target, and random target—and can perform various effects such as:

* **Stun**: Temporarily disables a creature.
* **Damage Over Time (DOT)**: Inflicts continuous damage.
* **Buff**: Temporarily enhances a creature’s stats.
* **Debuff**: Weakens an opponent’s stats.
* **Cure**: Removes negative effects.
* **Heal**: Restores a creature’s health.

Abilities have cooldowns, and buffs and debuffs can influence their effectiveness.

### Targeting type

Each ability will have its targeting type. There will be the following targeting types:

* **Single target:** This type of ability affects a selected single creature. Also, the single target abilities may be friendly, self-use, or enemy.&#x20;
* **Multi-targeting:** this ability targeting type affects all friendly or opponent creatures, sometimes even both.&#x20;
* **Random targeting:** this type of ability affects random targets. This type of ability will specify which targets it may affect: random ally creatures or random opponent creatures, or it can randomly affect any target.

### Default abilities

Based on the type of the creature, each of them has its default melee attacks. This card is always on them and can not be changed.

* Sharkman - Sharkman punch
* Zunnies -  Zunny melee
* Moon bits - Moon bits melee
* Oregon - Oregon Head bump

## Healing Potion <a href="#firstheading" id="firstheading"></a>

After the battles, the creatures will not recover their health and the easy way to heal them is by using healing items. There will be 3 types of healing potions:

* Small potion - recovers 20 health points - costs 25 crystals
* Medium potion - recovers 60 health points - costs 50 crystals
* Large potion - fully recovers creatures' health - costs 15 coins

\
Health potions can be acquired from the Item store or players can get them as rewards for completing PVE or PVP matches&#x20;
