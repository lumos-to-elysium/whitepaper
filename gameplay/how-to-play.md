## How cards work

Ability cards serve as the means to activate creature abilities during battles.&#x20;

Each creature possesses four ability card slots, with the first card dedicated to their primary attack.

The remaining three cards are randomly selected from the pool of available abilities for each creature.

If you are dissatisfied with a particular ability card assigned to your creature, fret not, as you'll have the option to shuffle the card, exchanging it for a new ability chosen at random.
