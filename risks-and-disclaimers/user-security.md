# User Security

**Beast Borne** takes the security of its users' assets and data very seriously. We have implemented several measures to ensure that players can confidently enjoy the game, knowing that their digital assets and personal information are well-protected. However, users are encouraged to follow best practices to enhance their security.

## **Secure Wallet Integration**

Beast Borne utilizes secure, decentralized wallet integrations such as MetaMask and other compatible wallets. These wallets allow users to control their private keys and digital assets. The game does not store private keys, ensuring users are the sole custodians of their cryptocurrency holdings, including **Beast Coin (BST)**.

**Private Key Protection**: Users are advised to keep their private keys secure and never share them with anyone. Losing a private key can result in the permanent loss of access to their assets.

## **Encryption and Data Protection**

All sensitive data within the Beast Borne ecosystem, including user account information and transaction data, is encrypted using industry-standard protocols. This ensures that personal data and transaction details are protected from unauthorized access or breaches.

* **End-to-End Encryption**: Communication between users and the game servers is encrypted, preventing interception by third parties.
* **Data Anonymity**: Where possible, user data is anonymized to protect privacy. This includes the use of blockchain technology, which allows transactions to be conducted with transparency but without revealing personal identities.

## **Secure Transactions**

Transactions involving BST and in-game assets are conducted through smart contracts on the Polygon network. These smart contracts are audited for security vulnerabilities to minimize the risk of exploits.

* **Smart Contract Audits**: Third-party security firms conduct regular audits to ensure that the gameâ€™s smart contracts are secure and functioning as intended.
* **Transaction Transparency**: All transactions on the blockchain are transparent and verifiable, allowing users to confirm their legitimacy.

## **Regular Security Updates**

The Beast Borne team is committed to maintaining a secure user environment. This includes regular security updates and patches to address potential vulnerabilities as they are discovered.

* **Proactive Security**: The development team monitors emerging security threats and works to implement updates that protect users from new vulnerabilities quickly.
* **User Notifications**: In the event of a security update or detected threat, users will be promptly notified with instructions on protecting their accounts and assets.

## **Reporting Security Issues**

Users are encouraged to immediately report any security issues or suspicious activities to the Beast Borne support team. By working together, we can ensure that the Beast Borne ecosystem remains safe and secure for everyone.
