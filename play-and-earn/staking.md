# Staking

## What is Staking?

Staking is a way to earn rewards by simply holding onto your **Beast Coin (BST)** tokens for a certain period. Think of it like a savings account where you deposit your money and earn interest over time. However, instead of earning interest from a bank, you earn more BST tokens as a reward for locking up your tokens within the game’s ecosystem.

## Staking Beast Coin (BST)

Staking is a core feature of the **Beast Borne** ecosystem. It allows players and investors to lock up their **Beast Coin (BST)** tokens for a fixed period to earn rewards. The staking mechanism in Beast Borne is inspired by the [HEX.io staking model](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], designed to incentivize long-term holding and active participation in the ecosystem.

## **How Staking Works**

### **Staking Period**

Participants can stake their BST tokens for a defined period, ranging from a few days to several years. The length of the staking period directly influences the rewards earned; longer staking periods yield higher returns.

### **Stake Bonuses**

Stakers are rewarded with additional BST tokens as an incentive to lock up their tokens. The rewards are calculated based on the amount of BST staked and the duration of the stake — the longer and larger the stake, the more significant the bonus.

### **Penalties for Early Withdrawal**

A penalty system is in place to discourage early withdrawals and promote long-term staking. If a staker decides to withdraw their BST tokens before the end of the staking period, they will incur a penalty. The penalty amount depends on how early the withdrawal occurs relative to the original staking commitment.

### **Interest and Yield**

Stakers earn interest on their staked BST, which compounds over time. The interest rate is determined by the overall staking participation within the Beast Borne ecosystem, encouraging a balance between staking and liquidity.

### **Flexibility and Control**

While the HEX.io model emphasizes long-term commitment, it also provides flexibility. Stakers can ladder their stakes—creating multiple stakes with different end dates—to maintain liquidity while still participating in the staking rewards.

## **Benefits of Staking BST**

### **Passive Income**&#x20;

Staking BST allows players and investors to earn passive income. Participants can generate returns by locking up their tokens without trading or actively participating in other activities.

### **Support for the Ecosystem**

By staking BST, participants contribute to the stability and growth of the Beast Borne economy. Staking reduces the circulating supply of BST, which can positively impact the token’s value and support the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.

## **Getting Started with Staking**

To begin staking, players and investors need to:

1. **Acquire BST Tokens:** Obtain BST through gameplay rewards, exchanges, or in-game events.
2. **Select Staking Period:** Choose a staking period that aligns with their financial goals and desired level of commitment.
3. **Initiate Stake:** Lock up their BST tokens through the staking interface provided by Beast Borne.
4. **Earn Rewards:** Watch their staked BST grow as they earn rewards over the staking period.
