## **Parent Creatures**

**Parent Creatures** are the foundation of the Beast Borne ecosystem. These creatures are minted at the game's launch and serve as the primary source for breeding, allowing players to expand their collection and create new, powerful offspring.

* **Breeding Capabilities**: Only parent creatures can breed and produce children's creatures. This makes them precious assets, essential for generating new creatures in the game.
* **Fixed Supply**: There will be 12,000 Parent Creatures, ensuring their scarcity and long-term value within the game.

### **Rarity Distribution**

* <mark style="color:yellow;">Common</mark> **Creatures**: 6,000 minted Common Parent Creatures form the most basic level, offering straightforward abilities and as a starting point for new players.
* <mark style="color:blue;">Rare</mark> **Creatures**: 3,600 minted Rare Parent Creatures provide enhanced abilities and stats, making them more valuable and desirable in battles and breeding.
* <mark style="color:purple;">Legendary</mark> **Creatures**: 2,400 minted Legendary Parent Creatures are the most powerful and rarest in the game, offering superior abilities and significant advantages in combat and breeding.

## **Children Creatures**

**Children's Creatures are born through the breeding process between two parent creatures**. These offspring inherit traits from their parents, resulting in diverse abilities, appearances, and stats.

* **Breeding Restrictions**: Unlike parent creatures, children's creatures cannot breed. This maintains the exclusivity of Parent Creatures and ensures a controlled expansion of the creature population within the game.
* **Inherited Traits**: Children inherit a mix of traits from their Parent Creatures, creating opportunities for players to strategically pair parents to achieve desired outcomes, such as specific abilities or enhanced stats.
* **Diversity and Strategy**: The diversity of Children Creatures adds depth to the game, allowing players to experiment with various combinations and build unique teams tailored to their play style.

**Strategic Importance**

The distinction between Parent and Children Creatures creates a strategic layer in Beast Borne, influencing how players approach breeding, battles, and resource management. Parent Creatures hold intrinsic value due to their breeding capabilities and play a crucial role in expanding the game's ecosystem by creating new, diverse Children Creatures.

As the supply of Parent Creatures is fixed, their value is expected to increase over time, especially as the game grows and the demand for new, unique Children Creatures rises. This dynamic encourages players to manage their Parent Creatures carefully, maximizing their potential through strategic breeding and gameplay decisions.

## The breeding

Players can breed two parent creatures to create new offspring. The breeding process uses hard currency and is subject to cooldowns based on the creatures' rarity. Breeding outcomes depend on the parent creatures' types and rarities, and each parent can breed a limited number of times.

There will be time-based limitations on breeding for each parent creature. The number of times a player can breed the parent creature during the first year depends on the creature's Rarity.

| Rarity                                       | Breedings limit | Breeding duration | Price per Rarity |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| <mark style="color:yellow;">Common</mark>    | 4               | 90 Days           | 75 $BST          |
| <mark style="color:blue;">Rare</mark>        | 6               | 60 Days           | 150 $BST         |
| <mark style="color:purple;">Legendary</mark> | 8               | 45 Days           | 225 $BST         |

After breeding, the player must wait the required amount of time to breed that creature again. The prices, chances, and breeding duration may change during a future release.
